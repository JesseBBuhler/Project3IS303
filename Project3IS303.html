This project will require you to watch tutorial videos in our learning suite course. Look for the videos called "Putting it all together" and watch those videos.

For this project you will do the following:

Create a folder called Project3
Use DB Browser and Create a database called MusicLibrary
Use DB Browser and Create a table in that database called Songs. The structure for the table is:
NOTE: We are not worrying about normalizing the database and will only use one table for now.
SongID, integer, not null, primary key, and auto increment
SongName, text, not null
ArtistID, text, not null
YearReleased, integer
In the Songs table use DB Browser and add the following records: (NOTE: the autoincrement will be generated by DB Browser so I did not include it here)
Bohemian Rhapsody, QUEEN, 1975

Don't Stop Believing, JOURNEY, 1981

Hey Jude, BEATLES, 1968

You will be using JavaScript/Node/Express to create the web site
You will use NPM to install
express
knex
body-parser
sqlite3
ejs
Create a server file called index.js
Make sure you have documented the name as Project3, the description as "My first node app", main as index.js, and the author as a comma-separated list of group member names. You can leave the other fields default or empty
Create a main page called index.ejs (in a views subfolder)
The index.ejs file should display all of the records from the Songs table. It should also have a delete button on the left of the record and an edit button on the right of the record.
Some where in this file there should be a button for adding a new record.
There should also be a button labeled Start Over
The delete button should route to DeleteSong and should receive the SongID. This is a post method and should delete the song from the Songs table. If there is an error then return a 500 status and the json of the err. Also display the err to the console log. If the delete works then redirect back to the root file for the website ("/")
The edit button should use the EditSong route and pass the data from the record to the editsong.ejs file. The data will be displayed in text inputs and allow the user to change the data. There should be a Save and Cancel button on this page. If the user clicks on the Save button then the data should be saved back to the record updating the fields. If the user clicks on the Cancel button then it should redirect back to the home back and display the records from the Song table. This should happen on the Save also.
If the user clicks on the Add button then it should use the AddSong route and take the user to the addsong.ejs file. When the user clicks on the Save button it should submit the new record and add it to the table and then redirect to the home page showing all of the records in the table.
If the user clicks on the Start Over button the system should delete all of the records in the Songs table and then reload the first initial 3 records stated in this assignment. Do not worry about resetting the SongID auto incremented value.
This is a group project but everyone should learn how to do these skills

Once completed, zip up the entire directory and ONE person will upload it to learning suite. Make sure you include the names of the individuals that worked on it.

The base score will be 85% with the remaining 15% for creativity and professionalism.

Make this look great!
